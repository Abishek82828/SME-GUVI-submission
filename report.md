Improve collections (reduce DSO)\n- **Why:** DSO is high (~1651 days), which traps cash in receivables.\n- **Actions:**\n  - Send payment reminders before due date (3/7/14-day cycle)\n  - Set a stop-credit rule for customers overdue >60 days\n  - Ask new customers for partial advance payment\n- **Impact:** Lower DSO improves cashflow and reduces risk.\n\n### 2. Reduce fixed EMI pressure\n- **Why:** EMI is 851.0% of monthly revenue, increasing default risk during low-sales months.\n- **Actions:**\n  - Prioritize prepayment of highest-interest debt first\n  - Avoid new fixed-cost borrowing until cashflow stabilizes\n  - Consider restructuring tenure to reduce EMI (compare total interest)\n- **Impact:** Lower EMI ratio increases credit readiness.\n\n### 3. Clear stale inventory\n- **Why:** 46 items have no movement for 90+ days, locking cash.\n- **Actions:**\n  - Run targeted discounts on dead stock\n  - Stop reordering slow SKUs until stock normalizes\n  - Track weekly aging inventory report\n- **Impact:** Releasing dead stock improves working capital quickly.\n\n## 6) Benchmarking\n- Industry median operating margin: **6.0%** | Yours: **8.8%**\n- Industry DSO: **15 days** | Yours: **1651 days**\n- Industry DPO: **30 days** | Yours: **657 days**\n\n## 7) Forecast (simple)\n- Method: `mean+trend_last6` | Horizon: 6 months\n  - 2027-01: Rev 13158.43, Exp 39456.11, OpProfit -26297.68\n  - 2027-02: Rev 13693.75, Exp 42294.34, OpProfit -28600.59\n  - 2027-03: Rev 14229.06, Exp 45132.56, OpProfit -30903.50\n  - 2027-04: Rev 14764.38, Exp 47970.78, OpProfit -33206.41\n  - 2027-05: Rev 15299.69, Exp 50809.01, OpProfit -35509.32\n  - 2027-06: Rev 15835.01, Exp 53647.23, OpProfit -37812.22\n\n## 8) Tax & Compliance (if provided)\n- Tax data not provided or not mapped.\n\n## Notes\n"}
